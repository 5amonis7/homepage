A custome Homepage I use for my desktop.

Moon button to the right to activate nightmode.

Hmaburger button on the left to open navbar.
In the navbar, there is links to different websites and at the bottom is an api to fetch the weather from openweathermap.

In the middle is the current time along with a phrase that gets updated based on the current time.
Right beneath that is a search bar that links the google with the results.
